# Dice-Rolling-Game-Remastered

Yep, its a game where you can roll to dices. If the dices show 7 or 11, you win. Else you lose.

It is mainly made in JavaScript. But have HTML for building blocks an items, and CSS for the styling of HTML.

I think this project is good for beginners, who wants to learn If, Else statement. But also use of the Math.random, and changing HTML content.
Its very simple but as a beginner i think you can learn alot of trying to make this project.
